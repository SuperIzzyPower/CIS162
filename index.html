<h2> About me </h2>

	<p>
		I recently received an Associates Degree in Economics and another in Natural Sciences from Cerritos College. My goal is to transfer to a university in the spring. I have been attending college part-time for many years and finally started attending full-time this summer. I plan to continue taking on full-time college coursework while keeping my full-time job. I work as a corporate pricing administrator, which means that I analyze data (mostly in Excel), create pricing models, streamline processes, and help develop strategies to increase the company's profitability. My workdays feel like a mixture of working on puzzles and creating data visualizations to tell a compelling story. I love it! My job is why I am considering pursuing a Data Science degree instead of an Economics degree. I have completed all the pre-requisites for both. So now the only thing left for me to do is make a decision.

	My favorite website is <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> because you can find anything your heart desires, take off from there and explore the world without ever leaving your seat.
